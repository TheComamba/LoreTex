To unlock the capabilities of \RpgTex{} in your document, only few steps are necessary:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use a documentclass that recognises the chapter command, like for example book or memoir.
\item Use the input command to include the main.tex file.
\item Call the loadLuacode command with the relative path from your document to the main folder.
\item Compile your document using the Lua\LaTeX{} compiler.
\end{enumerate}

The first two steps need to happen before the beginning of document, because \RpgTex{} uses two packages and defines several new commands. Including one to print its name.

Without any further preparation, you can now use some convenience functions for converting units to the metric system:
\begin{itemize}
\item A line \ft{10} long.
\item An area of \ftsquared{50}.
\item A volume of \ftcubed{10}.
\item A wall \inch{20} thick.
\item A distance of \mile{30}.
\item A stone weighing \lb{10}.
\item A keg holding \gallon{5} of wine.
\end{itemize}
